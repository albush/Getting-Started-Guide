*We recently asked our [Cloud Launch Team](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/an-insiders-look-at-the-cloud-launch-team/) to provide us with a checklist of all of the most pertinent information that they try to convey to their customers. This article represents just one of [seven milestones](getting_started_master_article.md) identified by the Launch Team.*

# Milestone 6: First Invoice

After 30 Days, you will receive your first cloud invoice. If you have any questions with your first invoice, contact your Launch Manager

## Notes about billing

* Cloud servers are billed at an hourly rate until they are deleted from the account
* Managed Infrastructure accounts have a $50 minimum support fee
* Managed Operations: SysOps accounts have a $500 minimum support fee
* Your monthly invoices will be available via your [MyCloud](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) Control panel (for security, we will not email you a copy of your invoice)
* You can get a more detailed report by [downloading the invoice as a CSV](https://community.rackspace.com/products/f/25/t/4950).
* You can view an estimation of your current charges in the Current Usage page of the MyCloud control panel (Account > Usage Overview)
