*We recently asked our [Cloud Launch Team](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/an-insiders-look-at-the-cloud-launch-team/) to provide us with a checklist of all of the most pertinent information that they try to convey to their customers. This article represents just one of seven milestones identified by the Launch Team.*

# Milestone 6: First Invoice

At 30 Days the customer will receive their first cloud invoice. It's important to follow-up with the customer to see if there are any questions about the invoice.

## Example issues might be:

* Bandwidth charges & Support costs
* Ensure customer understands $50 for MI and $500 for MO is just a minimum and not a flat fee
* Discuss storage fees where applicable

## Proactive Initiatives

* 30 days is a good time to run a Discovery Report
