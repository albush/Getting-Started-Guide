# Milestone 5:  Steady State

At milestone 5, we've reached the point where the customer is completely up and running on Rackspace. For many customers, this milestone occurs immediately after going live. For others, it's after one or more high traffic events. For others still, continually fluctuating traffic *is* steady state. Whenever this milestone occurs for you, there are some additional actions we recommend taking to make sure everything runs smoothly for you for as long as you are at Rackspace.

## Scaling back

If you've just completed a high traffic event - congratulations! Hopefully everything went well. Likely you'll not need to continue on with the expanded infrastructure you've built for to accommodate the enhanced traffic; if you do, then you've just had a very successful event. If you've followed our [guides for scaling up](https://community.rackspace.com/products/f/54/t/1009), you can follow them in reverse to scale back down. We recommend staggering the scale down, so that you don't scale your app too low to handle your traffic.
