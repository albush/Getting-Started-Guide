# Milestone 7: Graduation to main support

After the first 60 days, you will graduate from our Cloud Launch Program. Our Launch Managers will hand you off to our main support and account teams, which will continue to work with you as long as you are our customer.

We also recommend that you take this opportunity to double check all of your backup and monitoring configurations.

## Account review

We also want to review your account with you, and make sure that we have everything covered. For our Managed Operations service level customers, we can use a discovery tool to make sure your servers are all up to date and patched, explore any potential security issues that might have come up, and offer additional suggestions on improving your application architecture.

Account reviews are not only offered every 60 days, we're happy to take the time to review your account with you any time. We have found that Launch Graduation is a great time to take stock of your current situation, and use that opportunity to introduce you to the main support teams.

## Additional support options

If you need any additional assistance in your journey as a Rackspace customer, we urge you to give us a call, chat with us, or create a ticket, or stop by our [self-service support center](http://support.rackspace.com/); we're always here to help you. In addition, here are two other support options to consider.

### Upgrade your support level

We have a few different [support levels in the Rackspace Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/compare-service-levels), each with its own distinct advantages.

### Managed Infrastructure


### Managed Operations - SysOps

At the Managed Operations service level, our System Administrators are able to access your servers in order to support your server. For a full, updated list of what we support, see our [Linux](https://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/cloud-servers-with-managed-operations-support-for-linux) and [Windows](https://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/cloud-servers-with-managed-operations-support-for-windows) spheres of support articles. Many of our Managed Infrastructure customers choose to [upgrade their service level](https://community.rackspace.com/products/f/25/t/4891) in order to have an entire team of admins working 24x7x365 to support the servers hosting their applications. The upgrade process is fairly straight forward, and can be completed quickly. <!--For more information, listen to our podcast discussion of the benefits of upgrading the service level. -->


### Managed Operations - DevOps Automation

DevOps isn't a tool or a product. It's an approach to operations. By uniting development and operations teams to automate and standardize processes for infrastructure deployment, you get faster innovation, accelerated time to market, improved deployment quality, better operational efficiency, and more time to focus on your core business goals. Our DevOps customers choose this service level because their applications change frequently, and they benefit from the fast time to market as they roll out new features. [Our DevOps support team](http://www.rackspace.com/devops?cm_mmc=community-_-link-_-gsg-_-ab3) provides both advisory and automation services.  


## Self service support

Not every question you have as a customer will need to be answered by a Racker. Many of our customers have a DIY mentality, and other questions are more easily answered with a web search than a phone call. We have been building a self-service support infrastructure for just those interactions. All three support sources can be searched simultaneously through our support portal at [support.rackspace.com](http://support.rackspace.com/).

### Rackspace Community

The [Rackspace Community](https://community.rackspace.com/) is our newest support platform. In the Community our you can ask questions, and we answer them, or connect you with Racker subject matter experts to answer those questions. We also create original content to share our support Rackers' best practices. The Community is open to anyone, so stop by and join in the conversation.

### Rackspace Knowledge Center

Our [Knowledge Center](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/) is the definitive source on using our Rackspace Products. The KC includes FAQs, tutorials, and walkthroughs of many of our cloud products. The KC is a great place to exactly the answer you're looking for.

### Rackspace API Documentation

For our technical documentation, see our [API Documentation](http://docs.rackspace.com/). If you really need to know how something works, this documentation will tell you. Additionally, many of our new features are only available through the API in their early availability phases, so check the API Docs for instructions on new features.
