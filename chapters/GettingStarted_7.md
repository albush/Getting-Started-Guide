# Milestone 7: Graduation to main support

After the first 60 days, you will graduate from our Cloud Launch Program. Our Launch Managers will hand you off to our main support and account teams, which will continue to work with you as long as you are our customer.

We also recommend that you take this opportunity to double check all of your backup and monitoring configurations.

## Account review

We also want to review your account with you, and make sure that we have everything covered. We can use a discovery tool to make sure your servers are all up to date and patched, explore any potential security issues that might have come up, and offer additional suggestions on improving your appliation architecture.

Account reviews are not only offered every 60 days, we're happy to take the time to review your account with you any time. We have found that Launch Graduation is a great time to take stock of your current situation, and use that opportunity to introduce you to the main support teams.
