# Milestone 6: First billing cycle

You will receive your first invoice one month after signing up for your account. Your billing date will be the anniversary of your account creation. We will charge the credit card on file for any service usage on the account. Each subsequent month we will invoice on the account anniversary for usage since the previous invoice. We have a very good [Billing FAQ](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-cloud-billing-faq), and your Launch Manager can work with you on any additional questions you might have. Some highlights from the FAQ:

## Notes about billing

* Cloud servers are billed at an hourly rate until they are deleted from the account
* Managed Infrastructure accounts have a $50 minimum support fee
* Managed Operations: SysOps accounts have a $500 minimum support fee
* Your monthly invoices will be available via your [MyCloud](https://mycloud.rackspace.com) Control panel (for security, we will not email you a copy of your invoice)
* You can get a more detailed report by [downloading the invoice as a CSV](https://community.rackspace.com/products/f/25/t/4950).
* You can view an estimation of your current charges in the Current Usage page of the MyCloud control panel (Account > Usage Overview)

## Avoid unexpected charges by keeping your application secure.

One of the most common reasons we see for customers with unexpected charges on their invoice is a compromised server. Poor server and application security can lead to a compromised server, which can then be used for many different nefarious purposes, most of which will leave you stuck with the bill. Rackspace goes a long way to protect your server, but [server security is ultimately your responsibility](https://community.rackspace.com/products/f/54/t/5049). Take some time to [harden your server](https://community.rackspace.com/products/f/54/t/4934) to prevent a compromise. If you think you've been compromised, check out our guide for [investigating](https://community.rackspace.com/general/f/34/t/75) and [recovering](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/recovering-from-and-dealing-with-a-site-compromise) from a compromise.
