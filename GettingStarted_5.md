*We recently asked our [Cloud Launch Team](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/an-insiders-look-at-the-cloud-launch-team/) to provide us with a checklist of all of the most pertinent information that they try to convey to their customers. This article represents just one of [seven milestones](getting_started_master_article.md) identified by the Launch Team.*

# Milestone 5:  Steady State

After the high traffic event has been completed, the system should reach a steady state where no additional changes need to be made.

Monitoring should continue looking for when the traffic requests will taper off. It's at this point that maintenance windows should start to be planned. Cloud Databases will need to be downsized and nodes in the cloud load balancer can start to be drained.
