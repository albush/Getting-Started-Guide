This guide is long. If you read the associated content, it's even longer. The three most important things to remember:

1. **Rackers want to work with you, and see your success.** [It's what we do][1]. We want you to succeed, and we'll work with you to make that happen. Our Rackers are [available 24x7x365][2] to answer your questions and provide the guidance and support you need to get started and meet your goals.
2. **For best results, architect with scalability and redundancy in mind.** Our most successful customers have one thing in common: they architect their application to [avoid single points of failure and scale quickly][3]. Your application is your business; it makes you money. You need to protect that asset by architecting redundancy and scalability into the application.
3. **Test. A lot.** Anything you try is just a hunch until you've tested it. Do you know how many visitors your site's current configuration can support? Shouldn't you? Test for [benchmarks][4]; [load test][5] for as much traffic as you can ever imagine receiving; test for 5 times that. The more you test - and iterate off of the test results - [the more resilient your application][6] can be.
