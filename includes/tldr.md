This guide is long. If you read the associated content, it's even longer. The three most important things to remember:

1. **Rackers want to work with you, and see your success.** [It's what we do](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/tag/cloud-launch-team/). We want you to succeed, and we'll work with you to make that happen. Our Rackers are [available 24x7x365](http://www.rackspace.com/support) to answer your questions and provide the guidance and support you need to get started and meet your goals.
2. **For best results, architect with scalability and redundancy in mind.** Our most successful customers have one thing in common: they architect their application to [avoid single points of failure and scale quickly](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/fundamentals-of-cloud-architecture-the-seed-config-video/). Your application is your business; it makes you money. You need to protect that asset by architecting redundancy and scalability into the application.
3. **Test. A lot.** Anything you try is just a hunch until you've tested it. Do you know how many visitors your site's current configuration can support? Shouldn't you? Test for benchmarks; [load test](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/load-testing-your-site-with-load-impact-google-hangout-recap/) for as much traffic as you can ever imagine receiving; test for 5 times that. The more you test - and iterate off of the test results - the better you'll be able to keep your app online.
