## Introduction

We recently asked our [Cloud Launch Team][1] to share a checklist of the most pertinent information that they try to convey to their customers. What we received was an amazingly thorough guide to getting started with Rackspace - this team is incredibly talented, and it's well worth your time to have a conversation with them.

We have broken the list down into sections based on milestones our customers experience throughout the first 60 days of their customer journey at Rackspace. Most of the sections in this article include links to our Community and Knowledge Center additional information and context.
