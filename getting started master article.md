We recently asked our [Cloud Launch Team](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/an-insiders-look-at-the-cloud-launch-team/) to provide us with a checklist of all of the most pertinent information that they try to convey to their customers. What we received was an amazingly thorough guide to getting started with Rackspace - this team is incredibly talented, and it's well worth your time to have a conversation with them.  
To best communicate their notes, we have broken the list down into sections based on milestones our customers experience throughout the first 60 days of their time at Rackspace. Additionally, we have linked out to other Community and Knowledge Center content for additional information and context.

Milestone 1 - Welcome to Rackspace!
Milestone 2 - Building your application on Rackspace
