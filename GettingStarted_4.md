*We recently asked our [Cloud Launch Team](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/an-insiders-look-at-the-cloud-launch-team/) to provide us with a checklist of all of the most pertinent information that they try to convey to their customers. This article represents just one of seven milestones identified by the Launch Team.*

# Milestone 4:  Customer Event

This is the time when the customer will reveal their new site to the world.

For some customers this might be their launch date as it occurs when they point their DNS.  For others it might be when an event is airing, press release or some other kind of announcement.

The customer might ask for an administrator or Launch Manger to be present in case various systems start to buckle. It's also important to note that the customer's developer should also be present during this time.

## Be aware of possible issues that can occur during high traffic events & solutions to remedy

* Oversaturation of traffic to Web01 from other web servers
* Resource exhaustion & contention
* Reboot check

## Create awareness of event in advance

* Document time, POCs, config summary, tactical plans, proactive configuration of backups & domain monitoring, and pre-work by adding cloud load balancers & databases.
