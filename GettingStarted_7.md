*We recently asked our [Cloud Launch Team](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/an-insiders-look-at-the-cloud-launch-team/) to provide us with a checklist of all of the most pertinent information that they try to convey to their customers. This article represents just one of [seven milestones](getting_started_master_article.md) identified by the Launch Team.*

# Milestone 7: Graduation Date

With the customer's Graduation Date (at day 60) they move from Team D0 to their long term support team, the following needs to take place:

## Conduct warm handoff

* For MO customers go to team D3-4
* For MI customers go to team D4-2

## Monitoring Review

Make sure there are URL checks for all the customer's primary domains. This is important should the customer's site go offline, support will be notified

## Complete full Backups Review

* Web servers, DB servers, CBS,etc.
* Ensure customer understands costs & risks of not having backups

## Golden Image

* Golden image is a manual image of a server. When a server is deleted, all automated backups and content associated with that server is also deleted. Only manual images are kept
