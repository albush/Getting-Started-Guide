<!-- A timeline of your experience as a Rackspace Cloud Customer -->

*We recently asked our [Cloud Launch Team](http://www.rackspace.com/blog/an-insiders-look-at-the-cloud-launch-team/) to provide us with a checklist of all of the most pertinent information that they try to convey to their customers. This article represents just one of seven milestones identified by the Launch Team.*

# Milestone 1: Welcome to Rackspace!

The very first step in your customer journey is creating a cloud account with Rackspace. We try to contact everyone of our new customers, personally, to welcome them to Rackspace, and provide immediate assistance to those that need it, so make sure that the contact information you provide is accurate. We also recommend that you take the time to speak with one of our Launch Managers to discuss your plans, and work with them to meet your goals.

## Account activation tips

* Ensure your primary contact's email address is valid. This is where all ticket updates and communications will be sent
* Whitelist 'rackspace.com' and 'rackspacecloud.com' to ensure delivery to your mailbox
* Understand the [different account roles](https://community.rackspace.com/general/f/34/t/59).
* [Add your technical contact(s)](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/managing-role-based-access-control-rbac) to the account so that they can work with our support team when needed
* Make sure their contact information is correct
* Suggestion: [Setup a distribution list](https://community.rackspace.com/general/f/34/t/56) 'rackspace@yourdomain.com' for instance so all communication  is delivered to the correct team members

## Initial call with a launch manager (strongly recommended)

We invite you to join a call with one of our Launch Managers. They are available to all of our customers for the first 60 days after your account is created, free of charge. During an initial call, the Launch Managers will work with you to discover the following (among other things):

* Service Strategy: learn about your business, support expectations, end user experience
* Demand Management: learn about your traffic patterns of business, website activity, hosting priorities
* Financial Management: learn about your new vs. existing projects, hosting budget, compliance requirements, budget planning
* Supplier Management: how was your previous hosting experience? Why did you choose Rackspace?  Do you need to migrate anything to Rackspace?
* Service Level Management: discuss implementation activities, downtime tolerance, go live date
* Capacity Management: load balancers, horizontal computing, modularity
* Continuity Management: load testing, GET v. POST testing, HA v. continuous operation
* Security Testing: network access, user access, cryptographic controls, patching, etc.
* Availability Management: monitoring, backups

We will cover all of these topics and more in the remaining milestones.
